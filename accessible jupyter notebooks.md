# Using jupyter noebooks via screen reader

There is no currently reliably accessible solution. VSCode has some support, but it is flakey at best. Google Colab pretends to be accessible, but the interface makes no sense via screen reader.

THis project will do the following:

- learn how jupyter notebooks work
- first attempt a simple browser based solution
   + run server locally
   + simple interface with basic styling and as few keyboard shortcuts as possible
   + communicate with local python server to run cells and display output
